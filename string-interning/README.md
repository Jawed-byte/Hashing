# Concept of String Interning

String interning is an optimization technique used to store only one copy of each distinct string value, which can significantly reduce memory usage and speed up string comparisons. Instead of storing multiple identical strings, interning stores a single shared instance and references it wherever needed.

This is especially useful in scenarios where many duplicate strings occur, such as compilers, interpreters, or large-scale data processing systems.

# Implementation Steps of String Interning

## Maintain a String Pool

- Create a centralized data structure (commonly a hash map) that maps string values to unique identifiers (like indices).
- This pool ensures that each unique string is stored exactly once.

## Adding Strings to the Pool

- When a new string arrives, check if it already exists in the pool.
- If it does, return the existing unique identifier or reference.
- If it does not, add the string to the pool, assign a new unique identifier, and store the mapping.

## Retrieving Strings

- Use the unique identifier or reference to quickly retrieve the original string from the pool.
- This allows efficient lookup and avoids redundant string copies.

## Associating Data with Interned Strings

- In applications that require mapping keys (like integers) to strings, instead of storing the entire string repeatedly, store only the identifier from the intern pool.
- This saves memory and improves cache performance.

## Handling Default Values

- Pre-insert default or common strings into the pool to simplify handling of missing keys or default mappings.

## Efficiency and Performance

- Use efficient data structures like hash maps for constant-time insertion and lookup.
- Avoid unnecessary string copies by storing references or indices.
- Interned strings can be compared by their identifiers, enabling fast equality checks.

By following these steps, string interning provides a memory-efficient and performant way to manage large sets of strings, especially when many duplicates occur.
