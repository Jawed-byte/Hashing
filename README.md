# Hashing

A high-performance C++ implementation of various data structures and hashing techniques, featuring modern collision resolution strategies and memory-efficient designs.

## Features

### 1. Hash Map Implementations
- **Unordered Map**  
  Standard hash table implementation with chaining collision resolution
- **Cuckoo Hashing**  
  Advanced open-addressing scheme using two hash functions and constant worst-case lookups
- **Polynomial Rolling Hash**  
  Customizable string hashing with prime base and modulus configuration

### 2. Probabilistic Structures
- **Bloom Filter**  
  Space-efficient probabilistic membership checker with configurable false positive rates

### 3. String Optimization
- **String Interner**  
  Memory-efficient string storage with duplicate elimination and reference-based access
